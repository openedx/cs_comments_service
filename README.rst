An independent comment system which supports voting and nested comments. It
also supports features including instructor endorsement for education-aimed
discussion platforms.

Getting Started
---------------
If you are running cs_comments_service as part of edx-platform__ development under
devstack, it is strongly recommended to read `those setup documents`__ first.  Note that
devstack will take care of just about all of the installation, configuration, and
service management on your behalf. If running outside of devstack, continue reading below.

__ https://github.com/edx/edx-platform
__ https://github.com/edx/configuration/wiki/edX-Developer-Stack

This service relies on Elasticsearch and MongoDB. By default the service will use the Elasticsearch server available at
`http://localhost:9200` and the MongoDB server available at `localhost:27017`. This is suitable for local development;
however, if you wish to change these values, refer to `config/application.yml` and `config/mongoid.yml` for the
environment variables that can be set to override the defaults.

Install the requisite gems:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bundle install

Setup the search index. Note that the command below creates an alias with a unique name (e.g. content_20160101), and
assigns it a known alias: content. If you choose not to use the command below, you should still opt to reference your
index by an alias rather than the actual index name. This will enable you to swap out indices (e.g. reindex) without
having to take downtime or modify code with a new index name.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/rake search:initialize

Run ther server:

.. code-block::

    $ ruby app.rb

By default Sinatra runs on port `4567`. If you'd like to use a different port pass the `-p` parameter:

.. code-block::

    $ ruby app.rb -p 5678


Running Tests
-------------
Tests are built using the rspec__ framework, and can be run with the command below:

.. code-block::

    $ bin/rspec

If you'd like to view additional options for the command, append the `--help` option:

.. code-block::

    $ bin/rspec --help

Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)
---------------------------------------------------

To run the comments service in a language other than English, set the
``SERVICE_LANGUAGE`` environment variable to the `language code` for the
desired language.  Its default value is en-US.

Setting the language has no effect on user content stored by the service.
However, there are a few data validation messages that may be seen by end
users via the frontend in edx-platform__.  These will be
translated to ``SERVICE_LANGUAGE`` assuming a suitable translation file is
found in the locale/ directory.

__ https://github.com/edx/edx-platform

edX uses Transifex to host translations. To use the Transifex client, be sure
it is installed (``pip install transifex-client`` will do this for you), and
follow the instructions here__ to set up your ``.transifexrc`` file.

__ http://support.transifex.com/customer/portal/articles/1000855-configuring-the-client

To upload strings to Transifex for translation when you change the set
of translatable strings: ``bin/rake i18n:push``

To fetch the latest translations from Transifex: ``bin/rake i18n:pull``

The repository includes some translations so they will be available
upon deployment. To commit an update to these: ``bin/rake i18n:commit``
